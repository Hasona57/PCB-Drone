## ✅ Got the ESCs Working!!

After hours of testing, I finally got the **Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)** on the custom PCB to properly control the motors! Seeing them spin up for the first time (without jitter or going crazy) was a huge win — it feels like the drone is starting to *come alive*!

## 🔌 ESC Troubleshooting Context

The ESCs I’m using are **BLHeli_S**, and they’re connected to the flight controller via PWM outputs from the STM32 chip on the custom PCB I designed:

When I first powered on the drone, the ESCs beeped (good sign), but didn't respond to throttle commands from **Betaflight**. After checking the voltage rails with a multimeter and verifying that 5V and 3.3V were clean, I started investigating the **signal lines**.

## 🧪 What I Tried and Learned

- **✅ Verified GPIOs**:  
  Checked STM32 pin assignments in `target.h` of the Betaflight build — they were mismatched with my PCB routing. Updated the board definition and recompiled.

- **✅ Signal Frequency Check**:  
  Used an oscilloscope to probe motor outputs. Initially, no PWM signal even when arming. After fixing pin configs, I saw clean 1ms–2ms pulses at 50Hz.

- **✅ ESC Protocol Check**:  
  Betaflight was set to **DSHOT600**, but my ESCs only support **PWM**. Switched to PWM and ESCs finally responded to throttle.

## 📸 Images to Add

Make sure to upload these in your GitHub repo:
- ✅ Oscilloscope screenshot of PWM signal
- ✅ Photo of ESC/motor setup on bench
- ✅ Screenshot of Betaflight PWM config

## 📝 TL;DR

- Fixed STM32 pin config in Betaflight.
- Switched ESC protocol from DSHOT to PWM.
- Confirmed PWM output with oscilloscope.
- ESCs finally respond to throttle input.

⏱️ **Time spent this session:** 5 hours  
Most of it was debugging GPIO/pin config issues and reflashing firmware.
